Query recommendation systems have many problems keeping them from giving human explainable recommendations for what query might be helpful to run next. These issues include trying to explain black box AI decisions, needing to modify the training database of an AI to track causality, or other similar restrictions. My method to solve this problem doesn't involve these black box AI or changing the database, but instead learns about the database from your own queries to provide suggestions. This is done by looking at the queries provided by the user and producing suggestions to direct the user towards queries that might show them data that they had previously ignored, while still leaving the decision of whether they are worth following to the user. Due to the short and relatively simple process to create these suggestions, explaining the reason for them is easy. The results of my program is simple and intuitive query suggestions, but they do lack depth and help beyond what the user might see themselves. Further work would need to be done to expand this into a useful system.
